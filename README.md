# AkhiRed-Sentiment-Analyzer
The basic sentiment analyzer using AWS APIs Comprehend and Polly

AWS Comprehend - Amazon Comprehend is a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover valuable insights and connections in text.

AWS Polly - Amazon Polly is a cloud service by Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, that converts text into spoken audio. It allows developers to create speech-enabled applications and products. It was launched in November 2016 and now includes 60 voices across 29 languages.

The AkhiRed application will accept the input from the user, analyze the sentiment of text and acknowledge the sentiment using the Polly Text2Speech service.
